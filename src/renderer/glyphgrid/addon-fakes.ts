/**
 * The addon's test fakes: a recording `GridHandle`, a recording atlas, a fake decoration service, a
 * fake blink seam, and the `TermInternals` a terminal would supply.
 *
 * NOT a `.test.ts`, deliberately. Two test files need these — `addon.test.ts` and the shared
 * layer's, which drives the real addon through the real blink clock — and importing one test file
 * from another makes vitest COLLECT the imported file's whole suite a second time under the
 * importer. A plain module is the only way to share a harness. It is also dead code in a production
 * build: nothing outside the two test files imports it.
 *
 * It lives on the glyphgrid side because the dependency direction is canvas → glyphgrid. The layer
 * test may reach in here; this directory must never reach out.
