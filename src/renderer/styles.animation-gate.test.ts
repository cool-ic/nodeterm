/**
 * The animation gate is an ALL-OR-NOTHING fix, which is why it is enforced by scan rather than by
 * review.
 *
 * A running CSS animation obliges the compositor to produce a frame every vsync, and that cost is
 * paid once for the window, not once per animation. Measured on the Server Edition with a
 * 40-terminal canvas idling for 25 s under headless Chrome: 1.5 % total browser CPU with nothing
 * animating, 33 % with ONE node pulsing, 101 % with twenty, and 1.6 % with the same twenty paused.
 * The step is at the first animation. So a single `infinite` animation added later without the
 * gate does not make the feature 1/56th worse — it holds the frame loop open and takes the whole
 * win back, while every animation the gate DOES cover still looks correctly frozen, which is
 * exactly the kind of regression nobody notices by looking.
 *
 * Joining the gate means one of two things, and the allowlist below is for neither:
 *   - `animation-play-state: var(--nt-anim-state);` after the shorthand (the shorthand resets
 *     play-state, so it must come after), or
 *   - an explicit `:root[data-nt-window='idle']` rule that gives the element a static state.
