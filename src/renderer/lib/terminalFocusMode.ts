/**
 * Who decides which terminal node holds the keyboard: the POINTER, or a CLICK.
 *
 * Issue #757 — "option to disable X Window focus-follows-pointer (Mac-style click to select what
 * UI element has the input focus)". `TerminalNode`'s hover guard has always tied the keyboard to
 * the pointer: dwelling `settings.panHoverDelay` over a terminal focuses its xterm, and
 * `mouseleave` blurs it again and drops the node's agent-status active flag and presence focus. On
 * a crowded canvas that is the X11 "focus follows mouse" model, and a user who reaches for another
 * card, a second display or the sidebar while an agent is mid-prompt loses the keyboard every time.
 *
 * `settings.terminalFocusFollowsPointer` (default ON — the long-standing behaviour) picks the model:
 *
 * - **ON — focus follows the pointer, sloppily.** A hover dwell takes the keyboard, and the
 *   terminal KEEPS it after the pointer leaves — until another node takes it (its own dwell, a
 *   click) or the user clicks elsewhere. This used to be strict X11 focus-follows-mouse, where
 *   `mouseleave` blurred the xterm and dropped the active flag and presence focus: typing into a
 *   terminal while the mouse rested on the canvas silently went nowhere, and so did every reach for
 *   the sidebar mid-prompt. Only the hover GUARD still follows the pointer here (leaving re-arms
 *   it, so a pass-over scroll pans the canvas until the next dwell).
 * - **OFF — click to focus.** The pointer decides nothing. A click on the terminal (the guard's
 *   `onGuardClick` → `enterNow`, issue #87) or a "go to node" request takes the keyboard, and the
 *   terminal KEEPS it until focus really goes somewhere else: another node, the empty canvas
 *   (whose `onPaneClick` blurs the xterm textarea, issue #86), a text field. The guard follows
 *   DOM focus too.
 *
 * In BOTH modes the node's active flag and presence focus follow DOM focus, through
 * `useClickToFocus` (named for #757, where it was born) — see `focusLossOutcome`. The modes differ
 * only in how the keyboard is TAKEN (dwell or click) and in who owns the guard.
 *
 * Pure so the decisions are testable without a mounted xterm; `TerminalNode` owns the effects.
 */

/**
 * The setting as read from a hand-editable settings.json: only a literal `false` switches to click
 * to focus. Anything else (absent, a string, null) keeps the long-standing default, so a mangled

 * The one place the node's "I hold the keyboard" state is released in that mode, so it must tell
 * a real move from its look-alikes:
 *
 * - **Focus stayed inside the node** (the header's rename field, a header button, the ⌘M view's
 *   composer). The user is still working HERE → `keep`.
 * - **The window lost focus** (Cmd+Tab, a click on another app). Chromium fires `blur`/`focusout`
 *   on the focused element, but that element remains `document.activeElement` and is focused
 *   again on return — the terminal never stopped owning the keyboard → `keep`.
 * - **The node's own ⌘M view opening** (`lostIsCoveredXterm`). `useMdModeFocus` blurs the xterm and
 *   focuses nothing, so this focusout has no destination and no press — the same shape as a click
 *   on the empty canvas — yet the user is still looking at this node → `keep`. If they then click
 *   elsewhere, focus is already on `<body>` and `outsidePressReleases` ends it.
 * - **A press on this node's own chrome** (dragging it by the header, clicking its border). The
 *   browser moves focus to the React Flow wrapper (it is focusable) or to `<body>`, and either
 *   way the keystroke after it would land on the canvas — where a bare Backspace is
 *   `canvas.deleteSelection`. #757 asks that the terminal keep the keyboard until the user clicks a
 *   DIFFERENT card, so this hands it back → `reclaim`.
 *
 * Everything else — focus on another node's xterm or a text field, or on `<body>` because a click
 * landed on the empty canvas — is the user clicking elsewhere, which is exactly what #757 wants to
 * be the ONLY way to leave → `release`. A node that is gone answers `keep` rather than guessing.
