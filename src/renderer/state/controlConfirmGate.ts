 * Binds the pure `decideControlConfirm` to the live stores — the canvas-control confirm's
 * counterpart to `activePermissionMode`, and in its own module for the same reason that one is:
 * `projects.ts` imports `workspace.ts`, so a store that imports the projects store cannot live
 * anywhere those two can reach.
 *
 * The permission-mode half is where the git-shared-file trap is closed, and BOTH locks are applied
 * here: the machine-local `bypassMode` opt-in comes out of `settings.json`, and
 * `resolvePermissionModeWithSource` reports whether the resolved mode was the user's own GLOBAL
 * choice or an override that arrived in `.nodeterm/project.json` — which travels to everyone who
 * clones the repo. Only `'global'` can waive anything.
 *
 * **The version gate is deliberately NOT applied.** `gatePermissionMode` exists to degrade `auto`
 * to a bare command line for an old Claude CLI; it never touches `bypassPermissions`, and asking
 * it here would tie a security decision to a `claude --version` probe on a canvas whose agent may
 * not even be claude.

   * (@shared/control-off-screen), so the dispatch passes `ctlProject?.id`. Both halves below have
   * to follow it: the per-project waiver obviously, and the permission MODE too, because

 *
 * It PRUNES on the way in, like every `sidebarCollapsedItems` write: settings.json is forever, and
 * an entry keyed to a project the user deleted is a live security waiver nothing can show them.
 * `live` is every project the store holds, closed ones included — a closed project is parked, not
 * gone.
 *
 * The id being GRANTED survives the prune because the merge below happens after it, not because
 * of any exemption inside it — which matters for a project that went away between the dialog
 * appearing and the user answering it: their answer is still honoured. (`pruneCollapsedItems` has
 * an explicit `keepKey` for this; here the write order already says it, and a second mechanism
 * saying the same thing would be one no test could turn red.)
