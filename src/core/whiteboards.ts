// Where a whiteboard node's drawing lives (nodes/WhiteboardNode.tsx).
//
// The scene is NOT in the node's data. A board with a pasted screenshot is megabytes, and node
// data rides every 800 ms workspace save (the whole workspace in one IPC message, one ≤8 MiB
// Server Edition frame), the 256 KB-per-node team-sync cap, 100 canvas-undo snapshots and the
// phone mirror. So each board is a side file beside project.json, like a canvas image:
//
//   <cwd>/.nodeterm/whiteboards/<nodeId>.excalidraw   (+ <nodeId>.png, the picture the node shows)
//
// falling back to `<userData>/whiteboards/` for a cwd-less canvas, an SSH project (its cwd is on
// the remote host) or a project folder that has been deleted — the same cases, for the same
// reasons, as `canvasImageTarget` in canvas-images.ts.
//
// A folder project whose canvas is kept in app data (issue #1145) writes nothing into its folder:
// its boards go to the same layout under its own app-data root (`appDataProjectRoot` in
// workspace-store.ts), and the folder's boards — drawn before the move — are only read. See
// `WhiteboardLocation`.
//
// **The path is derived HERE from (project, node id), never accepted from the renderer.** A
// node's data comes from the git-shared project.json, which anyone with commit access can edit;
// taking a path from it would let a crafted canvas aim a read or an overwrite anywhere this
// process can reach. A node id is validated with `isSafeNodeId` (no separators, no `..`), so the
// only files this module ever touches are `<id>.excalidraw` / `<id>.png` in those two folders.
//
// **The project folder is bound by its REAL path** (`projectBoardsDir`). The id check covers the
// file name only: a repository can commit `.nodeterm` or `.nodeterm/whiteboards` as a symlink to any
// directory on this machine, and every component before the file name used to be followed — a save
// wrote `<id>.excalidraw` / `<id>.png` on the other side, and a read (which a hosted-team Viewer can
// ask for) served that side's files past the realpath jail every `fs:*` call gets. Each existing
// component is resolved and must stay inside the project's real root before anything is created
// through it; otherwise the project folder is not used and the board falls back to the app folder.
